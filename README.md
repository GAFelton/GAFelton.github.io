# GAFelton's Portfolio Site

[![Hits](https://hitcounter.pythonanywhere.com/count/tag.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gfelton.com)](https://www.gfelton.com/)

My portfolio page uses Zurb Foundation and is hosted via GitHub pages on my custom domain.

I am using a custom color palette, responsive images and layout, and a few tricks like responsive ordering and sticky project images. For that particular feature, the site is best viewed on a medium-sized screen.

My resume is embedded via Google's file viewer, but sometimes it does not load in properly. Reloading the page should fix this, but I am looking for a better solution.
